# Clustering

1) **KNN for Telco-Segmentations**: Imagine a telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups.

2) **Weather Station Clustering using DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering) & scikit-learn**: DBSCAN can be used here, for instance, to find the group of stations which show the same weather condition. As you can see, it not only finds different arbitrary shaped clusters, can find the denser part of data-centered samples by ignoring less-dense areas or noises.
